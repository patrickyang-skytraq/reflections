How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

very well

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

checking the history knows when the difference was introduced, and may link to the bug/result you are searching now.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?
=> manually can be more logical, 
   automatically can be more convenient and prevent huge loss, but is too tedius.


Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

=> Git might be for a bunch of files in a project, so need to allow saving multiple files in one commit (a snapshot)
   as for Google Docs, I thought it is a share of a single file among people, so not a project

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of file?

=> git log : first find the IDs with the log to find your interest point in the file history.
   git diff : then diff the ID-in-interest with its previous/following IDs or so.

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

=> revert back to previous snapshot in single command is convenient.
   when something wrong during development, just revert back to previous working snapshot.

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?
=> I will use it in one of my projects
